(12083744 CANADA INC.) is a company which\\nspecializes in the development of concentrated solar energy technology. The goal of the projects and\\nservices offered by the company is to greatly reduce the need for expensive solar panels by using tracking\\nmirrors which concentrate the sun’s energy. This is a technology which our team has spent ten years\\ndeveloping.\\n\\nOur first product is an automatic sun tracking dish which powers a Stirling engine and is aimed at the\\n\\neducational market. At present the main sources of renewable energy training for students are websites and\\nprinted materials, which are theoretical and certainly not ‘hands-on’. Our bench-scale product, which involves a\\nlive demonstration with the direct participation of students, trains them in solar tracking, solar energy capture,\\nand its conversion into mechanical and electrical energy. Therefore, our hands-on product lets the students\\nbenefit from direct involvement in solar technology. The sun’s energy is concentrated by means of this\\nreflecting off-centre dish. The Stirling engine, placed at the focal point, then converts this concentrated heat into\\nmechanical work and rotates a fly wheel. The fly wheel finally rotates a generator to produce electricity.\\nOur second product is a solar hybrid PV-Thermal linear Fresnel collector.\\n\\nWe also offer to customers aid in the development of an integrated sustainable methodology for water\\n\\ndesalination and the extraction of sea-salt powder for de-icing and as raw material for production of magnesium\\nand lithium for the use of government and international companies'},\n",
